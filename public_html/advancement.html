    <li>ARPA became DARPA: Defense Advanced Research Agency in 1958.</li>
    <li>J.C.R Licklider – a professor from MIT/psychologist who invented “information theory”. Information Theory was Professor Licklider’s invention of a message being able to check itself for errors, ultimately, the mathematics behind one part of the message being able to check if the other part of it was correct. </li>
    <li>Licklieder’s vision was computers would allow you to communicate better and that would allow you to connect all the computers together for efficiency.</li>
    <li>The first computers ever invented were expensive and “as big as a room” and were not intended to communicate.</li>
    <li>A graduate student from MIT named Dr. Leonard Kleinrock began applying queuing theory to data transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Queuing theory was a tool for evaluating computer and communications systems.
    <li>Kleinrock showed how packages of data would “queue” at the nodes of the communications network as they went through, this way the speed of the network was determined.</li>
    <li>He then showed how to speed up the network: demand access and distributed control.</li>
    <li>Demand access: “you don’t get it till you need it” is the key idea for effective resource sharing with data networks.</li>
    <li>Distributed Control: no one switched device or authority should control the entire network, rather every switch should share in that control, i.e decide the routing procedure, how much traffic allowed in, where it’s going, etc. when to do all the functions in a distributed fashion.</li>
    <li>Kleinrock’s ideas ended the telephone system of circuit switching.</li>
    <li>A circuit switching system connects a caller with the phone one is trying to reach creating a circuit between to the 2 phones; a very slow way for communication system.</li>
    <li>It was a manual telephone system.</li>
